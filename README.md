# TreasureHunt
Basic Treasure Hunt module, massive improvements coming

This module aims to create a treasure hunt for the player inside Terasology. As of now it is pretty small and has room for improvements:

- General code optimization and improvement.
- Added a OnPlayerFootstep event that refreshes player's postion relative to the chest. 
- Will add riddles instead of relative block position.
